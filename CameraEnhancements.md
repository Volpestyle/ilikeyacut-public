# Camera Implementation Enhancements

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive enhancements made to the ilikeyacut iOS camera implementation, focusing on AI processing optimization, robust networking, and offline capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. **ImageProcessor Service** (`/Services/ImageProcessor.swift`)
Handles all image processing operations optimized for AI model requirements:

- **AI Optimization**: Processes images to 1024x1024 resolution for optimal AI model input
- **Orientation Handling**: Fixes image orientation and handles selfie mirroring
- **Format Conversion**: Converts HEIF/HEIC to JPEG for compatibility
- **Memory Management**: Processes large images in chunks to avoid memory pressure
- **Compression**: Progressive quality reduction to meet size constraints

Key Features:
```swift
// Process image for AI model
imageProcessor.processForAI(image) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let processedImage):
        // Use processedImage.imageData for upload
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

### 2. **NetworkManager Service** (`/Services/NetworkManager.swift`)
Manages all network operations with enterprise-grade reliability:

- **Multipart Upload**: Efficient image upload with metadata
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) for failed uploads
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress monitoring
- **Background Sessions**: Continues uploads when app is backgrounded
- **Network Reachability**: Automatic detection of connectivity changes

Key Features:
```swift
// Upload image with progress tracking
let uploadID = networkManager.uploadImage(
    imageData,
    to: .uploadImage,
    metadata: metadata,
    progress: { progress in
        // Update UI with progress
    },
    completion: { result in
        // Handle upload result
    }
)
```

### 3. **KeychainManager Service** (`/Services/KeychainManager.swift`)
Secure storage for sensitive data using iOS Keychain:

- **API Key Storage**: Secure storage with biometric protection option
- **Credential Management**: User authentication tokens
- **Certificate Pinning**: Support for SSL pinning
- **Access Control**: Biometric authentication for sensitive data

### 4. **OfflineQueueManager Service** (`/Services/OfflineQueueManager.swift`)
Manages offline photo capture and sync:

- **Automatic Sync**: Resumes uploads when connection restored
- **Priority Queue**: Processes uploads by priority (urgent, high, normal, low)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles offline edits with merge strategies
- **Background Sync**: Continues sync when app is backgrounded
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor sync progress for multiple uploads

### 5. **Enhanced CameraManager** (`/Services/CameraManager.swift`)
Production-ready camera implementation:

- **AI-Optimized Capture**: Configures capture settings for optimal AI processing
- **Thermal Monitoring**: Adjusts quality based on device temperature
- **Orientation Support**: Proper handling of all device orientations
- **Low Light Boost**: Automatic enhancement in poor lighting
- **Focus/Exposure Lock**: Manual control for precise capture
- **Front Camera Mirroring**: Proper selfie orientation

## Data Flow

1. **Capture**: User takes photo â†’ CameraManager captures with optimal settings
2. **Processing**: ImageProcessor resizes to 1024x1024 and optimizes for AI
3. **Storage**: Photo saved to Core Data with metadata
4. **Upload**: If online, NetworkManager uploads with progress tracking
5. **Offline**: If offline, OfflineQueueManager queues for later sync
6. **Sync**: When connection restored, automatic background sync

## Core Data Schema

### PendingUpload Entity
- `id`: UUID
- `imageData`: Binary (external storage)
- `metadata`: Binary (JSON encoded)
- `priority`: Integer (0-3)
- `status`: String (pending/uploading/completed/failed)
- `retryCount`: Integer
- `createdAt`: Date
- `completedAt`: Date (optional)
- `uploadProgress`: Float
- `errorMessage`: String (optional)

## Configuration

### API Key Setup
1. Open Settings in the app
2. Tap "API Configuration"
3. Enter your API key
4. Key is securely stored in iOS Keychain

### Camera Settings

- **Low Light Boost**: Automatic enhancement
- **Grid Lines**: Rule of thirds overlay
- **Mirror Front Camera**: Selfie orientation

### Upload Settings
- **Auto Upload**: Enable/disable automatic upload
- **Cellular Data**: Allow uploads on cellular
- **Max Upload Size**: 1-10 MB limit

   - Test conflict resolution
   - Check priority ordering

## Usage Example

```swift
// In your view
@StateObject private var cameraManager = CameraManager()
@StateObject private var offlineQueue = OfflineQueueManager.shared

// Capture and process
cameraManager.capturePhoto { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let processedImage):
        // Image is optimized for AI (1024x1024)
        // Automatically queued for upload
        // Saved to Core Data
        
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle capture error
    }
}

// Monitor offline queue
if !offlineQueue.pendingUploads.isEmpty {
    Text("\(offlineQueue.pendingUploads.count) photos pending upload")
}

// Manual sync trigger
offlineQueue.processPendingUploads()
```
